## 10/10/2025 - finished the schamtic !  

finished the schematic for the devboard

notes on learning:

- decoupling capacitors filter out noise in power; 0.1uF for the each power pin (theres multiple in reality, kicad just merges the same ones together), and 1uF for each power line
- shield is the metal conductive part on the usb, connects to gnd to improve EMI (electromagnetic interference)
- 10uF bulk capacitors to filter out significant noise when 5v is stepped down to 3v3, both on input and output
- usb dp and dm go through 27ohm resistors to prevent distortion at high data speed, called termination resistors
- crystal oscillator: vibrating quartz crystal, amplified and fed to the MCU, this acts as a clock for all the other digital peripherals
- important here bc using usb c; data needs to come in at very specific times
- needs to be physically very close to the MCU
- XIN: output from crystal to MCU
- XOUT: output from MCU to crystal to control
- damping resistor to XOUT for signal integrity
- series capacitors (external load) for crystal to resonate at correct frequency
- SPI pins: MOSI (master output), MISO (master input), SCLK (crystal oscillator timing), SS/CS (device selection, add more of these for more devices)
- using quad SPI with this, but has 4 IO for 4x data transferring
- needs to be connected to the dedicated hardware controller (QSPI) on the MCU
- booting: if QSPI SS is GND when booting up, it goes into BOOTSEL, which is when it appears as a usb device
- done by adding a pull up resistor (guarantee HIGH when booting) to 3v3, and a resistor (limit current to pin) to a button that goes to GND
