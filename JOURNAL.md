## 10/10/2025 4 PM - finished the schamtic !  

finished the schematic for the devboard

notes on learning:

- decoupling capacitors filter out noise in power; 0.1uF for the each power pin (theres multiple in reality, kicad just merges the same ones together), and 1uF for each power line
- shield is the metal conductive part on the usb, connects to gnd to improve EMI (electromagnetic interference)
- 10uF bulk capacitors to filter out significant noise when 5v is stepped down to 3v3, both on input and output
- usb dp and dm go through 27ohm resistors to prevent distortion at high data speed, called termination resistors
- crystal oscillator: vibrating quartz crystal, amplified and fed to the MCU, this acts as a clock for all the other digital peripherals
- important here bc using usb c; data needs to come in at very specific times
- needs to be physically very close to the MCU
- XIN: output from crystal to MCU
- XOUT: output from MCU to crystal to control
- damping resistor to XOUT for signal integrity
- series capacitors (external load) for crystal to resonate at correct frequency
- SPI pins: MOSI (master output), MISO (master input), SCLK (crystal oscillator timing), SS/CS (device selection, add more of these for more devices)
- using quad SPI with this, but has 4 IO for 4x data transferring
- needs to be connected to the dedicated hardware controller (QSPI) on the MCU
- booting: if QSPI SS is GND when booting up, it goes into BOOTSEL, which is when it appears as a usb device
- done by adding a pull up resistor (guarantee HIGH when booting) to 3v3, and a resistor (limit current to pin) to a button that goes to GND

## 10/10/2025 7 PM - added imu + leds for customization  

added the icm-20602 imu on the devboard; picked it bc its the simplest one that jlcpcb has. it requires two capacitors on vdd for some reason, and one other one on vddio. also added leds, one is a power led (will be green), one is a bootloader led which hopefully going through RUN should only be on when the devboard is in BOOTSEL, and one last one thats just connected to gpio25 bc its unused.

## 10/10/2025 10 PM - partially routed pcb  

added footprints to everything, and partially routed the pcb. i have the rough shape of everything there, and roughly where everything is supposed to go. learned that you need to do differential pairs, and that the usb lines need to be the same length so that data travel at the same exact rate

## 10/11/2025 - more routing...  

this takes forever aaaa
routed more of the pcb, started the gnd plane which didnt do much bc my routing was very bad, separated a whole bunch of gnd pins. need to fix a lot of routing bc i have a bunch of bottom and top traces so i cant pass gnd through it :(
